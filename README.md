# Generic 8 bit audio DAC

These are KiCAD and Inkscape design files for a generic Covox Speech Thing compatible parallel port audio DAC.

This particular design uses a 100kΩ SIP R2R DAC with a 25.5kΩ load resistor and a pass-through connector for a printer and is therefore significantly closer to the original than most other imitations.
